# Awesome Security Solutions for AI Systems [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

## Intro

A curated list of awesome solutions to hard AI security problems and risks.  This stands in contrast to using AI for security (for offense or defense) and is explicitly meant to link to software and solutions that help solve the problems

Other lists cover the many excellent frameworks, papers, attacks, safety, and so forth.  But new GenAI systems are subject to all new classes of attacks and it has been difficult to find projects and companies that solve these problems as they rarely shine through the noise of "AI security" as a phrase.

If you want to contribute, create a PR.

## Confidential Computing

_Solutions that use secure enclaves and confidential computing to keep the data in parts of AI workflows private._

* [Fortanix Confidential AI](https://www.fortanix.com/platform/confidential-ai) - Run AI models inside Intel SGX and other enclave technologies

<!--
* [Opaque Systems](https://opaque.co/) - Run models in confidential compute environments

Leave here as a reminder. It seems Opaque has removed their confidential compute AI product and now has a product called Opaque Gateway that redacts and "compresses" prompts before sending on to OpenAI et al. But the product is in "waitlist" state as of May 2024 and so isn't eligible for this list. https://opaquegateway.opaque.co/

Leaving this here since they've now raised US$31M and have at least one rockstar founder, plus they were born out of a nice open source product: https://github.com/mc2-project/mc2,  so worth checking status again in awhile.

## Encryption and Data Protection

_Products that protect AI data privacy by encrypting the data. Infrastructure-layer encryption like filesystem encryption do not belong here. Only application-layer encryption solutions are eligible._

## Prompt Firewall and Redaction

_Products that intercept prompts and responses and apply security or privacy rules to them. We've blended two categories here because some prompt firewalls just redact private data (and then reidentify in the response) while others focus on identifying and blocking attacks like injection attacks or stopping data leaks. Many of the products in this category do all of the above, which is why they've been combined._

## QA

_Products that add quality controls and testing for GenAI workflows other than express testing of models. These tend to focus more on prompts and APIs._

* [Freeplay AI](https://freeplay.ai) - Test and track prompts, their performance and versions over time
* [Prompt Security Fuzzer](https://www.prompt.security/fuzzer) - Open-source tool to help you harden your GenAI applications [![code](https://img.shields.io/github/license/prompt-security/ps-fuzz)](https://github.com/prompt-security/ps-fuzz/)
